# keyLogger_jess
A keylogger made for personal security use. 

This code was designed for personal use, using it for unethical means is not the intention.
The implementation is simple, and everything can be easily told apart.
I don't mind anyone using anything that I've written down in the file, feel free to download and edit as desired.
